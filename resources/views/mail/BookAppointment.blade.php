    <p>
        Hi {!!$first!!},<br><br>
        Thank you for requesting a home survey with Chelmsford Gas Services.<br>
        The product you have requested from the online estimate calculator is: <strong>{!!$productchosen!!}</strong><br>
        @if($boostamain == 1)
            You have requested a boost-a-main to be considered in the home survey<br>
        @endif
        @if($accumulator == 1)
            You have requested an accumulator to be considered in the home survey<br>
        @endif
        And it has been estimated the new boiler installation will cost {!!$priceoutput!!}<br><br>
        A member of the Chelmsford Gas team will be in touch shortly to arrange a good time and day to visit your property.<br>
        Please also see attached our standard terms and conditions for your safe keeping.
